## GitHub Classroom IO Grader

### Overview
**GitHub Classroom IO Grader** is a plugin for GitHub Classroom's Autograder. Use it to ensure student executables output the correct values on tests.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Grading**: Test student code submissions and provide immediate feedback.
- **Customizable Test Setup**: Define pre-test setup commands and specific testing commands.
- **Flexible Output Comparison**: Supports multiple methods to compare the stdout output.
- **Timeout Control**: Limit the runtime of tests to prevent excessive resource usage.

| `setup-command` | Command to execute prior to the test, typically for environment setup or dependency installation.| No |
